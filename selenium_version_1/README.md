## ðŸš€ How to Run the Tests

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
2. Activate the environment:

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run tests:

   - To run all tests:

     ```bash
     pytest -v
     ```
5. ### Issues discovered during testing:

- The active_option UI element sometimes fails(in low resolution most frequently) to update consistently during tests, causing assertion failures.
- The postal code input form currently accepts letters and special characters (e.g., _, .). This suggests insufficient input validation, as no country uses postal codes composed only of letters or including special characters. Most countries use numeric or alphanumeric formats only.
